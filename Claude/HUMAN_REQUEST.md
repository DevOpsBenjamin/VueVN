# Human Request - Dual Phase Engine Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Branch:** `feature/dual-phase-engine`  
**Status:** Core architecture implemented, ready for integration testing

## üéØ What I've Implemented

### Core Components ‚úÖ
1. **Type Definitions** (`types.ts`)
   - `VNAction`, `HistoryEntry`, `Choice` interfaces
   - `EngineAPIForEvents` interface for natural TypeScript development
   - Updated `EngineState` with history, future, simulation flags

2. **Custom Logic Registry** (`CustomLogicRegistry.ts`)
   - Static registry for mini-games and custom functions
   - Type-safe interface with GameState parameter

3. **Error Handling** (`EngineErrors.ts`)
   - `JumpInterrupt` for event flow control
   - `VNInterruptError` for operation interruption

4. **NewEngine Class** (`NewEngine.ts`)
   - Dual-phase execution: simulation + playback
   - Simulation API that records actions without execution
   - Playback API that executes actions with real user interaction
   - History recording (50 entry limit)
   - Input handlers for left/right click navigation

5. **Timing Minigame** (`src/minigames/TimingGameLogic.ts`)
   - Circle with green/orange/red zones
   - Click to stop mechanism
   - Money rewards based on zone hit
   - Auto-registered with CustomLogicRegistry

## üöÄ Build Status
- ‚úÖ `npm run build sample` completes successfully
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Default exports added for build system compatibility

## ü§î What I Need Help With

### 1. Integration with Existing Engine
The new `NewEngine` is complete but **not yet integrated** with the existing engine system. I need guidance on:

- Should I replace the existing `Engine.ts` completely?
- How to integrate with the existing game loop and event discovery system?
- How to handle the transition from debug delays to the new engine?

### 2. Event Testing
I need to create or modify an event in the sample project to test:
- The dual-phase execution (simulation + playback)
- The timing minigame integration
- Choice handling with automatic jumps
- History navigation (go back/forward)

### 3. Missing Components
Still need to implement:
- `goBack()` and `goForward()` functionality
- Event discovery integration (with `EngineEvents.ts`)
- Save/load system updates
- Fast-forward for loading mid-event saves

### 4. UI Components
The engine needs:
- Visual indicators for fast-forwarding
- UI for timing minigame (currently just console-based)
- History debug panel for development

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Event Execution
1. Create a test event that uses the new `EngineAPIForEvents`
2. Test simulation phase generates correct actions
3. Test playback phase with real user interaction
4. Verify history recording works correctly

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Test timing minigame integration
2. Test choice selection with automatic jumps
3. Test go back/forward navigation
4. Test save/load functionality

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Replace or integrate with existing engine
2. Remove debug delays when stable
3. Performance testing with larger projects

## üìÅ Key Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `src/engine/runtime/NewEngine.ts` - Main dual-phase engine
- `src/engine/runtime/CustomLogicRegistry.ts` - Mini-game registry
- `src/engine/runtime/EngineErrors.ts` - Error classes
- `src/minigames/TimingGameLogic.ts` - Example minigame
- `Claude/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Development guidelines

**Modified Files:**
- `src/engine/runtime/types.ts` - Added new interfaces

## üéÆ Next Steps Needed

1. **Human Testing**: Run `npm run dev sample` and test basic functionality
2. **Event Creation**: Create a sample event that demonstrates all features
3. **Integration Decision**: Decide how to integrate with existing engine
4. **UI Development**: Create visual components for minigames and indicators

## üí° Architecture Validation

The dual-phase execution is implemented as designed:
- **Phase 1** (Simulation): Records all engine API calls as actions
- **Phase 2** (Playback): Executes actions with real user interaction
- **History**: Every action recorded with state snapshots for go back/forward
- **Custom Logic**: Mini-games exit event flow like choices do

The architecture should provide the natural TypeScript development experience you wanted while enabling perfect save/load and history functionality.

Ready for human review and testing! üöÄ
