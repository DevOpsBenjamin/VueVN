 *  - Neighborhood: Neighbor Entrance, City,  Garden
 *   (garden is in house but for this game we decide from hallway we can't go to garden directly must first get out of house)

 *  - Outside  <-> Neighbor Entrance
 *  - Outside  <-> Garden
 *  - Outside  <-> City

 * Note: Calls below use star links around the hubs (Hallway, Outside).
 * If LocationManager.link() is one-way, we add the reverse where needed.
