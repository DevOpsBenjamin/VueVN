 * Zones
 *  - House: Bedroom, LivingRoom, Mother Room
 *  - Outside hub: Outside (connects house â†’ neighborhood)

 *  - City hub: City (connects to Cafe)
 *   (garden is in house but for this game we decide from hallway we can't go to garden directly must first get out of house)

 * Edges (bidirectional intent)
 *  - Bedroom    <-> LivingRoom

 *  - Outside    <-> City

 *
 * Note: Calls below use star links around the hubs (Hallway, Outside).
 * If LocationManager.link() is one-way, we add the reverse where needed.
