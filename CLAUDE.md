# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VueVN is a visual novel engine built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite that provides a natural TypeScript development experience with perfect save/load and history functionality like Ren'Py.

**Current Status:** ✅ **Location-Centric Architecture Implemented** - The engine has been successfully migrated to location-centric architecture with automatic resource loading, supporting complex sandbox games with dozens of locations while maintaining developer simplicity and engine performance.

## Essential Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a new project
npm run add-project <project-name>

# Start development server for a project (with hot-reload and file watching)
npm run dev <project-name> [/verbose]

# Build a project for production
npm run build <project-name> [/ignore-translations /verbose]
```

## Key Architecture

### Location-Centric Project System

- Individual visual novels stored in `projects/` directory with location-centric architecture
- `VUEVN_PROJECT` environment variable determines active project
- Projects are isolated but share the same engine runtime
- **New Structure:**
  ```
  projects/sample/
  ├── locations/           # Location-specific resources
  │   ├── bedroom/
  │   │   ├── actions/     # Actions available in bedroom
  │   │   ├── events/      # Events that happen in bedroom
  │   │   ├── assets/      # Bedroom-specific images/sounds
  │   │   └── location.ts  # Location configuration
  │   └── city/
  ├── global/              # Non-location resources
  │   ├── events/          # System events (intro, cutscenes)
  │   └── assets/          # Global UI assets
  └── shared/              # Project-wide resources
      ├── npcs/
      ├── stores/
      └── types/
  ```

### Dual-Phase Engine Architecture

- **Simulation Phase**: Events execute to generate action sequences
- **Playback Phase**: Actions replay with user interaction
- **Manager-Based**: Engine delegates to specialized managers:
  - `HistoryManager`: Save/load and text-by-text navigation
  - `ActionExecutor`: Action playback and state management
  - `EventManager`: Event execution and jumping
  - `LocationManager`: **NEW** Location-specific resource loading
  - `NavigationManager`: Menu and UI state management
  - `InputManager`: User input handling
  - `SimulateRunner`: Event simulation orchestration
- **Natural Development**: Standard async/await TypeScript code for events

### Code Generation System

- Build system generates TypeScript files from project data using `scripts/generate.cts`
- Generated files in `src/generate/` provide type-safe access to project resources
- Automatic generation during development with file watching
- **New Generators:**
  - `generate-location-resources.cts`: Per-location resource indexes
  - `generate-global-events.cts`: Global event registration
- **Legacy Generators**: `generate-types-index.cts`, `generate-events-index.cts`, `generate-components-index.cts`, `generate-engine-index.cts`
- **Generates**: Location registries, global event indexes, type-safe resource access

## 🚨 Critical Import Rules

**MANDATORY**: All engine files MUST use generated imports for extensibility:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Allows user customization
import { Engine } from '@/generate/runtime';
import type { EngineState } from '@/generate/types';

// ❌ WRONG - Prevents user customization
import Engine from './Engine';
```

This preserves plugin capability - users can override any engine component through generated imports.

## Architecture Requirements

- **File Size Limit**: Keep files under 200-300 lines
- **Separation of Concerns**: Use focused, single-responsibility managers
- **Manager Pattern**: Engine.ts orchestrates, doesn't implement functionality
- **Type Safety**: All stores implement generated TypeScript interfaces

## 🚫 Design Restrictions

- **NO SVG ICONS**: Never use SVG paths in Vue components - they are obscure and hard to read. Use emojis or Unicode symbols instead when icons are needed. SVG paths generated by AI are particularly unreadable and should be avoided.

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy

No formal test suite - testing done via `sample` project with test events:

- `projects/sample/events/start/intro.ts`: Basic narrative flow
- `projects/sample/events/bedroom/morning/after-intro.ts`: Text and background testing
- `projects/sample/events/bedroom/choice-event.ts`: Choice navigation testing
- `projects/sample/events/bedroom/timing-event.ts`: Minigame and custom logic testing

### Build System Architecture

- `scripts/dev.cts`: Development server with hot-reload and file watching
- `scripts/build.cts`: Production builds with Vite single-file plugin
- `scripts/generate.cts`: Master code generation orchestrator
- `scripts/copy-assets.cts`: Asset handling during builds
- All scripts require `VUEVN_PROJECT` environment variable

### Current Status

**Build Status:** ✅ Production builds succeed (120.89 kB output)  
**Type Status:** ⚠️ TypeScript errors in UI components (build still works)

**Known Issues:**

- TypeScript errors in SaveLoadMenu.vue, Game.vue, and other UI components
- Engine core functionality works despite UI type errors
- `npm run check` fails but `npm run build` succeeds

## Runtime Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.0.0
- Valid `config.json` in each project
- `VUEVN_PROJECT` environment variable must be set for all operations
